	<h1>Hello, I'm Jie He</h1>
	<img src="images/profile.JPG" alt="Jie He" class="img-circle">
	<p>Currently, I am pursuing a doctorate in investigating “the business case for sustainable infrastructure investment?” which would look not only at the economics of infrastructure across its lifecycle but also would look at the value of resilience, sustainability (and use of green and blue infrastructure), affordability, etc. at the point of investment and hence address uncertainties and unknowns.

I am a motivated, detail-oriented, and organised student with solid communication and fast learning skills. I am actively looking for research opportunities in the civil infrastructure system and sustainable development towards a net zero transition.

· Skilled in Microsoft Office Software, Stata and SPSS, R Programming, SimVoi® Monte Carlo Simulation and the TreePlan, Tableau and SQL server.
· ACCA Foundational Level student. 
· Active in voluntary activities and event planning; interested in social media operation, a keen photographer and traveller.
· Good written and verbal communication skills in Mandarin (native) and English (proficient).</p>
